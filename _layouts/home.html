A definition of resiliency by the NAS, widely accepted by the building industries, is "the ability to plan and prepare for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">:disruptive events</a>.â€™ In the context of the built environment, the goal of a resilient system, at each of these four stages, is to have reduced failure probability, reduced consequences from failure, and reduced time to recover.
