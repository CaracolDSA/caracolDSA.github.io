# What is degrowth?

### : As defined in the book The Future is Degrowth, Schemelzer et al., 2022,

195:
“A degrowth society, we propose, is one which, in a democratic process of transformation:

- Enables global ecological justice - in other words, it transforms and reduces its material metabolism, and thus also production and consumption, in such a way that its way of life is ecologically sustainable in the long term and globally just;
- Strengthens social justice and self-determination and strives for a good life for all under the conditions of this changed metabolism; and
- Redesigns its institutions and infrastructure so that they are not dependent on growth and continuous expansion for their functioning.”


261: “Degrowth can thus also be understood as a form of reflection on the privileges produced through the imperial mode of living, which must be dismantled both in our everyday practices and politically.”

169:
“Degrowth can be understood as the convergence of seven forms of growth critique — the ecological, socio-economic, cultural, anti-capitalist, feminist, anti-industrialist, and South-North critique. Running through these various critiques of growth is the attempt to push back against the economic as a sphere of supposedly independent rationality and against economic calculation as the main basis for decision-making.” (

### : In [degrowth.info](https://degrowth.info/en/degrowth)’s words (2021):

Degrowth is an idea that critiques the global capitalist system which pursues growth at all costs, causing human exploitation and environmental destruction. The degrowth movement of activists and researchers advocates for societies that prioritize social and ecological well-being instead of corporate profits, over-production and excess consumption. This requires radical redistribution, reduction in the material size of the global economy, and a shift in common values towards care, solidarity and autonomy. Degrowth means transforming societies to ensure environmental justice and a good life for all within planetary boundaries.

### : Another gold standard definition:
Degrowth is a democratically planned reduction of energy and resource use in rich countries designed to bring the economy back into balance with the living world in a way that creates more just, egalitarian, and ecologically coherent societies ([Hickel, 2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2020.1812222)). In other words, it is [socialism without growth](https://braveneweurope.com/timothee-parrique-giorgos-kallis-degrowth-socialism-without-growth#sdfootnote1sym). The goal is to abandon GDP as a measure of well-being, and create steady-state economies that can exist in perpetuity and harmony with the biosphere.
Note: The degrowth analysis primarily targets the formerly (or currently, depending on your political persuasion) colonial countries of the world in the Global North -- the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. The first piece linked above explains why.

### : [Timothee Parrique](https://timotheeparrique.com/sufficiency-means-degrowth/)’s definition (2022): 
“…A planned and democratic reduction of production and consumption in rich countries to lower ecological pressures and inequalities while improving well-being for all.”

### Must-reads for understanding:

[Less is More](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1119823/less-is-more/9781786091215.html) (2020) by Jason Hickel

> “Jason Hickel shows that recovering the commons and decolonizing nature, cultures, and humanity are necessary conditions for hope of a common future in our common home.  By extracting less we leave more for other species, other people and future generations, thus creating well-being for all. In an ecologically interconnected world, less is more.”
_— Vandana Shiva_

[The Future is Degrowth](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3989-the-future-is-degrowth) (2022) by Andrea Vetter, Matthias Schmelzer, and Aaron Vasintjan

> “A most comprehensive analysis of the different trends converging in the degrowth movement, showing its capacity to both subvert the logic of capitalism and project visions of social justice. A book that powerfully challenges any reductive views of degrowth.”
_– Silvia Federici_

[The Case for Degrowth](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Case+for+Degrowth-p-9781509535620) (2020) by Susan Paulson, Giorgos Kallis, and Giacomo D'Alisa
Drawing on emerging initiatives and enduring traditions around the world, [the authors] advance a radical degrowth vision and outline policies to shape work and care, income and investment that avoid exploitative and unsustainable practices. Degrowth, they argue, can be achieved through transformative strategies that allow societies to slow down by design, not disaster.

Exploring Degrowth (2020)

[Degrowth in Movement](https://www.johnhuntpublishing.com/zer0-books/our-books/degrowth-movements)(s) by Burkhardt et al. (2020)
A study of the many movements that comprise the meta-movement called degrowth. Questions addressed: How is the relation between the degrowth movement and other social movements and perspectives? What can the degrowth movement learn from these other movements? And the other way around, what can other social movements and perspectives learn from each other as well as from degrowth ideas and practices? What common proposals, but also which contradictions, oppositions and tensions exist? What alliances could be possible?


[Limits: Why Malthus was Wrong and Why Environmentalists Should Care](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=29999)(2020) by G. Kallis
Western culture is infatuated with the dream of going beyond, even as it is increasingly haunted by the specter of apocalypse: drought, famine, nuclear winter. How did we come to think of the planet and its limits as we do? This book reclaims, redefines, and makes an impassioned plea for limits—a notion central to environmentalism—clearing them from their association with Malthusianism and the ideology and politics that go along with it.

[Degrowth: A Vocabulary for a New Era](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309291920_DEGROWTH_A_Vocabulary_for_a_New_Era_E-BOOK) (2014) by Various
‘Simplicity’, ‘conviviality’, ‘autonomy’, ‘care’, ‘commons’ and ‘dépense’ are some of the words that express what a degrowth society might look like. Degrowth: A vocabulary for a new era is the first English language book to comprehensively cover the burgeoning literature on degrowth. It presents and explains the different lines of thought, imaginaries and proposed courses of action that together complete the degrowth puzzle. The book brings together the top scholars writing in the field with young researchers who cultivate the research frontier and activists who practise degrowth on the ground.

[Degrowth - The Economy: Key Ideas](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/degrowth/9781911116806)(2018) by G. Kallis 
Giorgos Kallis provides a clear and succinct guide to the central ideas of degrowth theory and explores what it would take for an economy to transition to a position that enables it to prosper without growth. This is the first coherent, unified theory of degrowth in book form. It’s more of a textbook than anything else. Note: the book can be extremely dense at times.

## :x Hickel

>“While austerity calls for scarcity in order to generate more growth, degrowth calls for abundance in order to render growth unnecessary.”

>“...the IPCC (2018) has for the first time published a scenario for reducing emissions in line with the Paris Agreement that does not rely on speculative negative emissions technologies. Developed by Grubler et al. (2018) and known as Low Energy Demand (LED), the scenario works by reducing global energy consumption by 40% by 2050, which makes it much more feasible to achieve a transition to 100% clean energy. The key feature of this scenario is that global material production and consumption declines significantly: “The aggregate total material output decreases by close to 20 per cent from today, one-third due to dematerialization, and two-thirds due to improvements in material efficiency.” LED differentiates between the global North and South. Industrial production and consumption declines by 42% in the North and 12% in the South. Given improvements in energy efficiency, this translates into industrial energy demand declining by 57% in the North and 23% in the South.”  

>The LED model represents a “degrowth” scenario – a planned reduction of the material and energy throughput of the global economy. Its inclusion in the IPCC report as the only scenario that does not rely on questionable negative emissions technologies suggests that degrowth may be the only feasible way to achieve the emissions reductions required by the Paris Agreement. This is a major milestone in climate mitigation theory. What is appealing about this approach is that it not only addresses emissions and climate change, but also reduces ecological impact across a range of other key indicators, including deforestation, chemical pollution, soil depletion, biodiversity loss, and so on (Rockstrom et al., 2009; Steffen et al., 2015).

## :x Quotes



>“The core idea [of the ‘imperial mode of living’ concept] is that everyday life in the capitalist centers is essentially made possible through the (violent) shaping of socio-ecological relations in the Global South, and that includes the more or less unlimited access to labor power, natural resources, and pollution sinks on a global scale.” (167)

>“The realization that technology, infrastructure, and production facilities not only need to be appropriated but also transformed and (partially) wound down is central to degrowth.” (156)

>“The mastery of nature in all its variants — above all in the techno-scientific belief in progress but also in relation to modern temporality or human-animal relations — thus becomes the central object of [the degrowth critique of industrialism].” (153)

>“Any attempt to break the compulsion of nature by breaking nature only succumbs more deeply to that compulsion. That has been the trajectory of European civilization. Degrowth aims at breaking this trajectory.” (153)

>“Degrowth thus aims at collectively determining forms of technology that do not fall into these irrational traps of the ‘more is better’ ideology of technological progress, limiting the use of those technologies that stand in the way of a good life for all.” (152)

>“The massive expansion of technical systems and infrastructures, especially since the mid-twentieth century, is a major cause of ecological problems (see section 3.1).” (149)

>“...the goal of a degrowth society must be to overcome industrialism toward a post-industrial society that strives for a fundamentally different kind of technology, which means a profound transformation and democratization of the means of production and material infrastructures such as electricity networks, transport routes, and communication technologies (see chapter 5).” (144)

>“...degrowth as a whole can be understood as an approach that integrates feminist positions: the rejection of Homo economicus as a structuring image; the demand for part-time work for all, or an upgrading of subsistence work; the criticism of capitalist logics capturing more and more areas of life; and the critique of the domination of nature through scientific reason are all widely accepted positions in degrowth discussions.” (142)

>“[Precautionary economics] removes the distinction between ‘productive’ and ‘reproductive’ — human production is seen as embedded in nature’s production and reproduction activities, whether within or beyond a market economy. The basis of precautionary economics is an ‘ethics of care’ that leads to a precautionary — future-oriented, preventive, careful — rationality that serves to sustain life.” (141)

>“Degrowth’s ecological materialism enables a critical debate about the biophysical scale and form of an emancipatory and post-capitalist society, and degrowth’s critique of capitalism, having evolved somewhat on its own, offers a unique contribution to the debate on post-capitalism.” (132)

>“...a degrowth-inspired critique of capitalist growth as the materialization of accumulation could deepen widely held understandings of capitalism by focusing on otherwise neglected aspects, such as the material dimension of growth, social metabolism, appropriation, consumer society, artificial scarcity, or dépense.” (131)

>“...degrowth is not about imposing limits on society according to natural scarcity, but about regaining autonomy to collectively create public abundance, and also deliberate and set limits.” (129)

>“The term dépense thus adds  two ideas to the criticism of capitalism. First, it opens up the possibility of dealing with overproduction - a feature present in most societies as abundance to be spent collectively but solved in a very destructive way in capitalist societies through endless reinvestment. Second, it illustrates, through pointing to the expenditure of surplus in all human societies, that the logic of scarcity within capitalism is not a universal truth, but a historically contingent phenomenon.” (127)

>“...going ‘through’ capitalism to arrive at socialism, as accelerationists promote, is not only undesirable but also impossible, as capitalism destroys more than it can create or reorganize.” (125)

>“Quality of life does not depend on growth but instead on factors such as equality, prosperity, trust, social security, political participation, and the appreciation of care work — none of which require GDP growth." (103)

>“...all economic activity, regardless of social organization, is subject to material, ecological, and physical limitations.” (83)

>“Technological progress and non-fossil energy sources (such as the sun, wind, water, or biomass) cannot beat the entropy law in the long term, especially since resources and land are inherently limited. From this analysis, Georgescu-Roegen deduced that if we begin from an analysis that is grounded in the laws of physics, we can only conceive of an economy that consumes less and less energy and material, since nothing can be 100 percent recycled and since capturing renewable energy depends on material resources which are themselves limited.” (82)

>“...Georgescu-Roegen showed how what we call the economy, which is understood largely as a system of market exchange, is in fact a complex system of flows and stocks of energy and materials, each of which has different properties and potential for sustainable re-use.” (81)


## :x IPCC

> Efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes, in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising development, are a key mitigation strategy in scenarios reaching atmospheric CO2eq concentrations of about 450 or 500ppm by 2100 (robust evidence, high agreement). Near-term reductions in energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies, provide more flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon intensive infrastructures, and are associated with important co-benefits. Both integrated and sectoral studies provide similar estimates for energy demand reductions in the transport, buildings and industry sectors for 2030 and 2050 _**(IPCC 2014, 21).**_

> Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation potential in some sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change. (medium evidence, medium agreement). Emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns (e.g., mobility demand and mode, energy use in households, choice of longer-lasting products) and dietary change and reduction in food wastes. A number of options including monetary and non-monetary incentives as well as information measures may facilitate behavioural changes _**(IPCC 2014, 21).**_

> Nuclear energy is a mature low-GHG emission source of baseload power, but its share of global electricity generation has been declining (since 1993). Nuclear energy could make an increasing contribution to low carbon energy supply, but a variety of barriers and risks exist (robust evidence, high agreement). Those include: operational risks, and the associated concerns, uranium mining risks, financial and regulatory risks, unresolved waste management issues, nuclear weapon proliferation concerns, and adverse public opinion (robust evidence, high agreement). New fuel cycles and reactor technologies addressing some of these issues are being investigated and progress in research and development has been made concerning safety and waste disposal **_(IPCC 2014, 22)_**.

> Technical and behavioural mitigation measures for all transport modes, plus new infrastructure and urban redevelopment investments, could reduce final energy demand in 2050 by around 40% below the baseline, with the mitigation potential assessed to be higher than reported in the AR4 (robust evidence, medium agreement). Projected energy efficiency and vehicle performance improvements range from 30–50% in 2030 relative to 2010 depending on transport mode and vehicle type (medium evidence, medium agreement). Integrated urban planning, transit-oriented development, more compact urban form that supports cycling and walking, can all lead to modal shifts as can, in the longer term, urban redevelopment and investments in new infrastructure such as high-speed rail systems that reduce short-haul air travel demand (medium evidence, medium agreement). Such mitigation measures are challenging, have uncertain outcomes, and could reduce transport GHG emissions by 20–50% in 2050 compared to baseline (limited evidence, low agreement) _**(IPCC 2014, 22-23).**_

> Improvements in GHG emission efficiency and in the efficiency of material use, recycling and re-use of
materials and products, and overall reductions in product demand (e.g., through a more intensive use of products) and service demand could, in addition to energy efficiency, help reduce GHG emissions below the baseline level in the industry sector (medium evidence, high agreement). Many emission-reducing options are cost effective, profitable and associated with multiple co-benefits (better environmental compliance, health benefits etc.). In the long term, a shift to low-carbon electricity, new industrial processes, radical product innovations (e.g., alternatives to cement), or CCS (e.g., to mitigate process emissions) could contribute to significant GHG emission reductions. Lack of policy and experiences in material and product service efficiency are major barriers _**(IPCC 2014, 25).**_

> Systemic approaches and collaborative activities across companies and sectors can reduce energy and material consumption and thus GHG emissions (robust evidence, high agreement). The application of cross-cutting technologies (e.g., efficient motors) and measures (e.g., reducing air or steam leaks) in both large energy intensive industries and small and medium enterprises can improve process performance and plant efficiency cost-effectively. Cooperation across companies (e.g., in industrial parks) and sectors could include the sharing of infrastructure, information, and waste heat utilization _**(IPCC 2014, 25).**_
