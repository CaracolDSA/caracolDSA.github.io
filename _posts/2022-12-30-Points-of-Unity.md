We are thrilled to introduce Degrowth Caucus.  Our caucus is based on the idea that the Left should integrate degrowth into its politics for several important reasons, including to hit the climate targets socialists have embraced as vital political goals. <!--more--> We have formed at a critical juncture in human history. The decade of the [:Green New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal) is upon us, characterized by a rapidly closing window for sufficient climate action, a resurgent Left in the U.S. and a growing eco-fascist movement globally. We believe that being vocal and explicit about the need for degrowth can help rather than hurt the socialist movement, as well as help birth the new culture we need to manage without growth. However, we realize that the dialogue between degrowth and ecosocialism is a work in progress. 


We endorse the overall goals of the degrowth movement, which we summarize here and elaborate on in our points of unity below:

#### 1. Reduce the material and energy throughput (production, consumption, and waste) of the Global North globally wealthy individuals, and capitalist class so that...

1. ecosystems can recover; and

2. the Global South has the ecological space to grow its energy and material use for human needs satisfaction.

#### 2. Redistribute resources and wealth within and between countries, and from the wealthy and capitalist classes to the working class 

1. In payment of climate reparations;

2. To fortify societies against worsening climate impacts; and 

3. To increase quality of life, well-being, health, and human flourishing through universal public services and green infrastructure.

4. to reduce the purchasing power and consumption among the rich who are most responsible for ecological overshoot.

#### 3. Transition equitably from a fossil fuel-based, growth-dependentoriented capitalist economy to a regenerative, steady-state, ecosocialistn ecosocialist, regenerative, steady-state one.

1. **Maximize** humanity’s chances of keeping global heating at or below 1.5C — not 2C — below pre-industrial levels.

2. **Increase and improve** the working class’s free time to achieve greater health and human development, including better actualization of our physical, intellectual, artistic, scientific, and social potential.

3. **Decolonize** the global economy and our growth-indoctrinated imaginaries to redefine prosperity not just in quantitative material but also qualitative terms.

<br>
**Our caucus is thus dedicated to the following purposes:**
<br>

* Conducting political education within DSA on what degrowth is and why we believe the socialist project cannot do without it.
* Producing ecosocialist analysis from a degrowth perspective.
* Endorsing and supporting candidates for DSA elections whom we believe understand and are aligned with degrowth ecosocialist principles.
* Workshopping how best to ‘lead with degrowth’ in class-struggle campaigns, i.e. whether we should do so explicitly or implicitly.
* Developing messaging and campaigns centering or otherwise incorporating degrowth ideas, policies, and or approaches for building working-class power.

## :x 1

1. Capitalism is a political and economic world-system that derives value from the exploitation of labor and natural resources. Its dynamic of exploitation (the profit motive) drives the endless accumulation, or growth, of capital wealth by externalizing its social and ecological costs. In turn, these costs have endlessly accumulated, resulting in a planetary crisis, of which climate change is a part. 

2. Several major trends constitute this crisis: the sixth mass extinction and biodiversity loss, **reversible and irreversible** destruction of life-support ecosystems, plastic and toxin accumulation in all biomass and organisms, habitat destruction due to mining and industrial agriculture, and dispossession of Indigenous land protectors from their sovereign territories, among others.

3. We affirm what scientists have already observed: biophysical, planetary limits to economic growth exist ([Steffen et al., 2015](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1259855)). 

4. Taking ecological pressure off humanity’s life-support ecosystems is a central goal of degrowth.


## :x 2

1.  We endorse DSA’s Green New Deal Principles and seek to expand upon them with our work, as they omit points that are critical to addressing the climate and broader ecological crisis. Transitioning to 100% renewable energy sources and shoring up infrastructure for climate resilience and sustainability will require massive public investments of financial and material resources. However, we can reduce the material intensity of the global energy transition as much as possible through energy demand reduction and prioritizing electrified mass transit instead of private automobiles, among other tactics.

2.  Selective economic expansion to advance social and ecological goals is necessary and important to degrow toward a just, ecologically regenerative economy.

3. A Green New Deal without growth would primarily entail two things. On the one hand, it would entail a robust program of decommodification (of at least basic services such as nutrition, public transit, healthcare, education, and housing), undermining from its very inception the capitalist measure of value—its profit motive and concomitant growth imperative. On the other hand, it must do this while downscaling the overall material throughput in countries like the U.S., whose material footprints are over four times their global fair share [cite].

4.  Substantial localization is necessary from a climate mitigation perspective because it reduces energy use. We would support empowering regional and local economies to produce their own essential goods and services to the maximum extent possible. Importation of luxury items, commodities, and products regional economies cannot produce themselves within democratically established guardrails will likely be called for.

5. Moreover, degrowth is interested in the materiality of supply chains, unequal ecological exchange, and the social reproduction of everyday life that, as it stands, relies on immense amounts of land, energy, and materials. 

6. The transformation to an ecologically stable society requires more than merely transforming energy systems. For example, the meat-and-monocrop food system, for example, must also be transformed to supply far more plant-based foods. An ecosocialist food system requires that we switch to ecologically coherent forms of food cultivation, namely worker-owned agroecology and agroforestry systems.

7. We support ecosocialist dépense, the democratic expenditure of society’s productive surplus. Dépense answers the problem of what to do with overproduction under ecosocialist degrowth. Another useful aspect of dépense is that it shows how scarcity logic under capitalism is historically specific, not a universal truth (Schmelzer et al. 2022, 127).

1.  The scientific literature overwhelmingly fails to provide evidence for absolute decoupling of material use, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy use from economic growth. Therefore, we are aligned with the best available science in rejecting arguments that so-called “green growth” is a viable way to avert climate catastrophe. 

2.  Instead we contend that we can only keep global heating at or below an increase of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels this century by degrowing the North.

3.  Climate change is best understood as a global cataclysm in the making because it is causing fundamental, widespread, drastic, and lasting changes to Earth systems over extremely fast timescales in terms of Earth’s history [CITE]. While climate change is not fully reversible, some if not all of the worst effects of it are still likely preventable ([IPCC, 2022](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/)). 

4. As degrowth ecosocialists, we center the crucial understanding that shifting economies in the Global North to run on much lower levels of energy and resource use makes it easier for humanity to decarbonize our energy systems and meet climate targets in the short time we have left. 


## :x 4

1.  As internationalists, we stand firmly against imperialism, racial capitalism, and for decolonizing the global economy. Full decolonization requires a thorough application of equity. **Contraction and convergence**—where the Global North’s energy and material use contracts so that societies in the Global South can increase their energy and material use—is necessary to achieve a globally fair material foundation for human flourishing within biophysical boundaries.

2.  We acknowledge the ways that colonial history has shaped capitalism and the international political economic order. To be effective, degrowth must be an internationalist ecosocialist project. Therefore, it must address this colonial history in its proposals and political strategies. To do this, we have to transform the international economic and financial architecture that maintains Northern power through coercion and oppression of Southern nations, peoples, and popular movements. Instruments of such oppression, including debt strangulation, sanctions, corporate domination, and political disenfranchisement must end.

3.  A degrowth transition in the Global North must be democratic or it is not degrowth. We are committed to creating a post-growth, ecosocialist world democratically. 

4.  We acknowledge that the international economy has structured uneven patterns of ecological theft from land bases in the South to the North for production of high-value goods ([Dorninger et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800920300938)). Second, the North has unfairly taken up more than its fair share of the “atmospheric commons” with its greenhouse gas pollution. We perforce acknowledge that our country, the United States, owes a massive ecological and climate debt to Southern countries, whose social movements have long called for climate reparations to ameliorate that debt. Degrowth locates front and center the imperative to pay this debt back in the form of grants and technological transfers, _inter alia_.

5.  Furthermore, global justice requires that the global economy transition from an unjust imperial mode of living to a just, post-carbon, ecologically coherent and solidary mode that facilitates human flourishing ([Brand and Wissen, 2017](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316717147_The_Imperial_Mode_of_Living)).

6.  Global ecological justice in the degrowth ecosocialist sense means, unequivocally, the total elimination of world poverty and electrification of all households everywhere, along with establishing other material standards for well-being. Envisioning what an equitable standard of living for every human being would look like is a prerequisite for achieving ecological justice and grasping its large-scale requirements. We believe all people have a right to a basic minimum of material goods and electricity so that they can lead the healthiest, most fulfilled life possible despite a destabilizing biosphere; these are the material requirements for human flourishing. 

7.  Two concepts we lift up from the scientific literature are decent living energy (DLE) and decent living standards (DLS) (Figure 1) ([Millward-Hopkins, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378020307512); [Rao and Min, 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-017-1650-0)). DLE describes the minimum amount of energy needed to live well, while DLS traces the material requisites of a good life. Aspects of DLS include access to durable, modern, affordable, energy efficient and climate resilient housing; ready access to day-to-day technologies that improve well-being, including refrigeration, washing machines, and multi-modal transportation, especially electrified public transit, among other things. As Millward-Hopkins et al. (2020) elaborate, “sufficiency is far more materially generous than many” degrowth opponents assume.

1.  For capitalism, reproductive labor is valued only insofar as it is exploitable in market exchange. Socialist feminism highlights that reproductive labor is never valuable in itself for capitalism. We believe that many forms of labor are intrinsically valuable and ought to be socially recognizable as such. 

2.  No socially appropriate form of value is compatible with the accumulation of capital wealth. Reproductivity requires an end to the arbitrary bifurcation between reproductive, unpaid, women-dominated labor and conventional, paid, male-dominated, and privileged labor that depends on the former to exist.

3.  Degrowth valorizes care as socially necessary labor but also recognizes the extent to which care work has historically been a definitive expectation of women. Thus, whereas care work must be expanded within a regenerative political economy, it must be ungendered and equitably distributed as well.

1. There can be no question whether modern technologies will be deployed in service of a degrowth transition. Instead, the question is which ones and at what scales. While one and the same technology can be used for various ends, different technologies are nevertheless conditioned by, and condition further, different historical trajectories—a fact that socialists cannot stand to ignore. The status quo whereby tech capitalists innovate first and let society deal with the consequences second has produced a particular image of modern technology that is both unsustainable and oppressive to the working class. One timely example of this is greenwashing by corporations and captured governments promoting false solutions in the form of growth-enabling technologies, including forms of carbon capture and storage (CCS) such as direct air capture (DACCS) and bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) ([CIEL, 2021](https://www.ciel.org/organizations-demand-policymakers-reject-carbon-capture-and-storage/)). Thus, we call for democratic control over technological research, development, manufacturing, and rollout.

2. Technologies ought to be contextually appropriate. Factors of appropriateness include use value relative to social necessity, energy demand and pollution for production relative to maintenance, and durability relative to recyclability, among others.

3.  We support a philosophy of convivial technology, that is, technologies that facilitate interpersonal connection, can be easily replicated by different people under different conditions, and can be managed democratically rather than technocratically ([Vetter, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652617304213)).

4. Furthermore, we do not oppose but embrace certain high technologies, especially those essential for modern material comforts and a high quality of life. Some such examples are the Internet, laptops, mobile phones, high-speed rail, GPS systems and satellites, refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pumps, solar panels, wind turbines, rechargeable batteries, and so forth. Nevertheless, they must be developed to satisfy requirements of appropriateness, as above. For example, until viable alternatives to high-speed air travel are available, we support the limited use of conventional jets for emergency/humanitarian aid, political uses, and equitably rationed overseas travel. See our fact sheet on technology for more context here.

5. We recognize the critical role of technology in empowering Global Southern countries to meet their needs, and call for extensive technology transfers and releasing of intellectual property.
 
## :x 7

1.  We must dare to imagine and agitate for the post-carbon, post-capitalist systems we want _now_, embarking on political education projects while implementing DSA’s theory of change to build a mass movement for a radical Green New Deal (Aronoff et al. 2019, Ajl 2021, DSA Ecosocialist Working Group 2019). 

2.  The Left’s tasks are to transform the political economy for socio-ecological justice and help the multiracial working class understand and desire the new society we must urgently build, in order to_ transform the U.S. way of life so that it values personal well-being and high quality public services rather than the pursuit of private wealth.

3.  We need to pattern lower carbon forms of consumption and lifeways, prioritizing well-being for all through public provisioning. We can do this in large part by creating landscapes of public luxury, robust climate resilient infrastructure, and universal public services. The Left must spearhead a counter-hegemonic cultural transformation based on cooperation and commoning, respecting planetary boundaries, and promoting sustainable and fair allocation of resources within countries and between the global North and South.

4.  We recognize that degrowth is a “big tent” movement of movements and that ideological diversity is one of its strengths. Several notable movements fall under the umbrella of degrowth, including [:ecofeminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecofeminism), [:_Buen vivir/Sumak Kawsay_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumak_kawsay), [ecoswaraj/radical ecological democracy](https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2021/08/eco-swaraj-towards-a-rainbow-recovery-for-justice-and-sustainability/), [:ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy), [:social ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_ecology_(Bookchin)), [:the rights of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_of_nature), [:right to repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair), [:solidarity economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_economy), [:anti-imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-imperialism), and increasingly, [:ecosocialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-socialism).

5.  Degrowth is utopian precisely because the crises we face are so overwhelming that they demand a utopian response, a clarion call for a better world.

## :x 8

1.   Any future political economic system, including an ecosocialist[^6] one, cannot bring human activities to within sustainable planetary boundaries in perpetuity unless it purges endless economic growth as an economic policy goal and achieves physical equilibrium with its life-support ecosystems (LSEs). Degrowth combines an empirically sound body of theory with a policy program for a sustainable future ecosocialist economy that is not reliant on the growth imperative. However, degrowth lacks a robust theory of class struggle and socio-political change. Therefore, securing a livable planet for the future generations necessitates integrating degrowth and ecosocialism. In short, each without the other is sure to fail.

2.  Degrowth is ecosocialist and centers ecological justice. The **degrowth ecosocialism** we espouse is class struggle-oriented because we know that sustainable degrowth is only possible by defeating the capitalist class with organized people power. Moreover, as degrowth ecosocialists we seek to abolish unjust systems of economic violence, incarceration, and the systemic racism inherent in racial capitalism. We affirm the need to replace institutions and concepts that legitimize overproduction and wealth hoarding for the rich with egalitarian, ecosocialist institutions and ecologically coherent social relations that can operate without economic growth. 

3.  Degrowth is part of a necessary response to capitalism’s unresolvable internal contradictions, some of which have breached Earth’s ecological limits. Politicizing our social metabolism is necessary at a time of impending, global ecological collapse and climate breakdown.

4.  Degrowth is materialist in its alignment with the eco-Marxist analysis of the biosphere. Ecological Marxists understand that the planet’s biophysical boundaries constitute humanity’s ultimate set of material conditions, with their physical constraints and ecological dynamics.

	

## Afterword or Epilogue

In sum, degrowth uniquely makes possible an ecologically coherent and socially just ecosocialist economy. Such an economy would: be oriented around use values instead of exchange values; be based on democratic ecological planning; organize production through worker and community ownership and management; regulate consumption to prioritize and equalize sufficiency emissions; democratically allocate surplus; and protect and expand access to all types of commons. It would also be smaller in its total energy and material consumption than the current capitalist economy. Crucially, to the degree that ecomodernist ideologies and narratives of so-called “green growth” ignore or run counter to the necessary reduction of economic throughput in accordance with planetary boundaries, they must be rejected as incompatible with the degrowth ecosocialist project we seek to further.

## : PARKING LOT



The energy-limitedconstrained future we envision are descending into raisesbegs  the question: what renewable energy requirements emissions are strictly necessary to provide a high level of human well-being and optimize quality of life for U.S. Americans? Which emissions are unnecessary or luxurious? These are critical policy questions for the Left that we are interested in helping answer. Such questions are also integral to conveying to the public our vision of an ecosocialist society. 


## : QUOTE BANK (choose from these for the preamble / points if desired):

Schmelzer et al. in The Future is Degrowth (2022, ) -

_“...degrowth poses a set of key questions that all emancipatory alternatives need to address, which are often ignored. Degrowth offers answers to them as well. If people want to know how to address the challenges of ecological destruction, the ideology of capitalism, or the industrial, hierarchical, and imperial mode of production, degrowth is much more advanced than many other realms of debate – and this includes many of the debates on the left.” (p.297)_

_“...we argue for a nuanced approach that democratically weighs the benefits and costs of technologies based on social, ecological, and participatory criteria and accordingly for a society that autonomously sets limits.” (294)_

_“Ultimately, the development of a degrowth society is a question of decolonization — as it concerns who owns the land, who takes care of the land, and how we can build a world of abundance that does not exclude whole groups of people.” (290)_

“...advancing visionary policies and experimenting with local alternatives form two sides of the same coin — which ought to be brought together discursively in the degrowth framework_.” (270)_

_“Building up a counter-hegemony that can undo the growth paradigm, re-orient our economy toward well-being, and scale down social metabolism in the interim would, conversely, also reshape our daily lives, our imaginaries, and the way we conduct politics and manage the economy.” (269)_

_“...the scale of action needed requires a powerful actor, and the state currently remains the dominant actor on the world stage, being one of the key loci of struggle for climate justice, labor, feminist, and decolonial movements alike.” (264)_

_“Non-reformist degrowth policies, however, are not only central to promoting the generalization of a cooperative economy. They are also important to overcome the dependence by current institutions and infrastructures on growth and to achieve a mode of production and living based on solidarity at the level of society as a whole.” (264)_

_“These more revolutionary nowtopias can be seen as ‘territories in resistance’ which actively seek to model new forms of democratic government that are in opposition to a growth-based, highly centralized, hierarchical, and  unecological social structure.” (259) - referring to Rojava and Zapatista societies (ZLF)_

_“Top-down reforms allow the expansion and scaling up of nowtopias, while, without nowtopias, people will remain unable to imagine how radical reforms could improve their lives and thus desire and fight for their implementation.” (254)_

_“A fundamental change in the productive forces of modern industrial societies requires both different technical models and changed ownership structures: as long as the primacy of economic efficiency — rather than the criteria of sustainability and utility — dominates design processes and investments in technical infrastructures, this transformation will not succeed.” (229)_

_“Of course, just like there is no single, unified vision of a degrowth utopia, there is also not a single path to get there, but several paths, often crossing.” (213)_

_“A prerequisite for a degrowth society would therefore be to restructure all relevant social institutions in such a way that they can function without economic growth, or to create new growth-independent institutions that can fulfill the functions of the existing ones.” (208)_

_“...material infrastructures… as well as large-scale, highly complex mega-projects and systems… create path dependencies and growth imperatives. These will continue to require — not least due to their increasing complexity — material, energetic, and technological expansion in the future.” (207)_

_“A sustainable level of consumption requires addressing not only the extremely unequal consumption between different world regions and countries, but also their historical trajectory. This means all existing and remaining wealth, resources, raw materials, and emissions budgets would be distributed fairly, both between countries and regions of the world and within them.” (201)_

_“...achieving global ecological justice will require a planned contraction of economic activity to a globally equitable level and a deprivileging of those people who currently externalize the costs of their mode of living to others — humans and non-humans — elsewhere or in the future. _

_“A central element of a degrowth society is therefore that the material metabolism with nature, and therefore also economic production in different societies, is aligned with a long-term, ecologically sustainable, and globally generalizable level._

_“Degrowth explicitly aims at improving the living conditions for everyone — including those in the Global North” who are materially struggling. “Degrowth, however claims that this can be achieved without increasing overall economic output (which would be unsustainable and globally unjust) by tackling inequalities and guaranteeing public abundance… **It’s not a politics of less, but a politics of enough for all.”**_

_(197)_

_“...the core of degrowth, with its emphasis on ecological justice, a critique of all forms of exploitation and hierarchies, and a vision of solidarity, points to the very opposite of conservative, anti-modern, or regressive growth critiques… Degrowth’s strength is its holistic view.” (177)_

_“The core idea [of the ‘imperial mode of living’ concept] is that everyday life in the capitalist centers is essentially made possible through the (violent) shaping of socio-ecological relations in the Global South, and that includes the more or less unlimited access to labor power, natural resources, and pollution sinks on a global scale.” (167)_

_“The realization that technology, infrastructure, and production facilities not only need to be appropriated but also transformed and (partially) wound down is central to degrowth.” (156)_

_“The mastery of nature in all its variants — above all in the techno-scientific belief in progress but also in relation to modern temporality or human-animal relations — thus becomes the central object of [the degrowth critique of industrialism].” (153)_

_“Any attempt to break the compulsion of nature by breaking nature only succumbs more deeply to that compulsion. That has been the trajectory of European civilization. Degrowth aims at breaking this trajectory.” (153)_

_“Degrowth thus aims at collectively determining forms of technology that do not fall into these irrational traps of the ‘more is better’ ideology of technological progress, limiting the use of those technologies that stand in the way of a good life for all.” (152)_

_“The massive expansion of technical systems and infrastructures, especially since the mid-twentieth century, is a major cause of ecological problems (see section 3.1).” (149)_

_“...the goal of a degrowth society must be to overcome industrialism toward a post-industrial society that strives for a fundamentally different kind of technology, which means a profound transformation and democratization of the means of production and material infrastructures such as electricity networks, transport routes, and communication technologies (see chapter 5).” (144)_

_“...degrowth as a whole can be understood as an approach that integrates feminist positions: the rejection of _Homo economicus_ as a structuring image; the demand for part-time work for all, or an upgrading of subsistence work; the criticism of capitalist logics capturing more and more areas of life; and the critique of the domination of nature through scientific reason are all widely accepted positions in degrowth discussions.” (142)_

_“[Precautionary economics] removes the distinction between ‘productive’ and ‘reproductive’ — human production is seen as embedded in nature’s production and reproduction activities, whether within or beyond a market economy. The basis of precautionary economics is an ‘ethics of care’ that leads to a precautionary — future-oriented, preventive, careful — rationality that serves to sustain life.” (141)_

_“Degrowth’s ecological materialism enables a critical debate about the biophysical scale and form of an emancipatory and post-capitalist society, and degrowth’s critique of capitalism, having evolved somewhat on its own, offers a unique contribution to the debate on post-capitalism.” (132)_

_“...a degrowth-inspired critique of capitalist growth as the materialization of accumulation could deepen widely held understandings of capitalism by focusing on otherwise neglected aspects, such as the material dimension of growth, social metabolism, appropriation, consumer society, artificial scarcity, or dépense.” (131)_

_“...degrowth is not about imposing limits on society according to natural scarcity, but about regaining autonomy to collectively create public abundance, and also deliberate and set limits.” (129)_

_“The term dépense thus adds  two ideas to the criticism of capitalism. First, it opens up the possibility of dealing with overproduction - a feature present in most societies as abundance to be spent collectively but solved in a very destructive way in capitalist societies through endless reinvestment. Second, it illustrates, through pointing to the expenditure of surplus in all human societies, that the logic of scarcity within capitalism is not a universal truth, but a historically contingent phenomenon.” (127)_

_“...going ‘through’ capitalism to arrive at socialism, as accelerationists promote, is not only undesirable but also impossible, as capitalism destroys more than it can create or reorganize.” _(125)

_“Quality of life does not depend on growth but instead on factors such as equality, prosperity, trust, social security, political participation, and the appreciation of care work — none of which require GDP growth." (103)_

_“...all economic activity, regardless of social organization, is subject to material, ecological, and physical limitations.” (83)_

_“Technological progress and non-fossil energy sources (such as the sun, wind, water, or biomass) cannot beat the entropy law in the long term, especially since resources and land are inherently limited. From this analysis, Georgescu-Roegen deduced that if we begin from an analysis that is grounded in the laws of physics, we can only conceive of an economy that consumes less and less energy and material, since nothing can be 100 percent recycled and since capturing renewable energy depends on material resources which are themselves limited.” (82)_

_“...Georgescu-Roegen showed how what we call the economy, which is understood largely as a system of market exchange, is in fact a complex system of flows and stocks of energy and materials, each of which has different properties and potential for sustainable re-use.” (81)_

     4/03 - do we want to invoke the language of [biophysical] limits/planetary boundaries, danger of exceeding them, and need to return our economy ?
     
     Bump 5.1 first sentence up to be the point, followed atsome point by the current point language?
     
      Mention need to transcend carbon reductionism / tunnel vision.

     4/03 - Problem with the decoupling argument is important and should be included in this document/”technology won’t save us.” We agree decoupling is not possible and sufficient/we reject that argument. Decoupling could potentially work over longer timescales, but our argument is that we have to confront the economy right now by shrinking and transforming the economy. Lots of socialists lack this understanding or haven’t thought it through. This point is especially important compared to other POUs because it emphasizes that degrowth is essential/not optional.

[^3]:
     These scientific grounds alone are sufficient to warrant rejection of any mode of production that relies on growth, e.g. left (or right) ecomodernism, “green growth”
